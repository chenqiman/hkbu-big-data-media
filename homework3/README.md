Hotpot is becoming more and more popular in Shenzhen nowadays. 

There could be two main story points in this case: 

1)find out how much a hotpot meal may cost per person in Shenzhen, that means a new-open hotpot resteraurant can choose a similar price range for their own restaurant to ensure a good reputation

2)find out what areas include the most hotpot restaurants, that means a new-open hotpot restaurant should be careful with these competitive areas.

In order to achieve this goal, I scraped one of the website at the Dianping.com, containing the complete information of all the hotpot restaurants in Shenzhen.
